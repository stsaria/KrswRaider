*This repository should be viewed as historical, never to be updated.
## What is Krsw Raider
Krsw Raider is a Discord troll tool created by an organization called ctkp.

However, this tool is very dangerous because it was equipped with Grabber, a program that diverts information from the computer.
## Krsw Raider without grabber
Of course, we are publishing this as historical source code, but some of you may want to run it.

For this reason, we also have the source code for Krsw Raider without Grabber in it.
If you want to use it, please use it.
### Required Files
- tokens.txt   File to store Discord tokens.
- proxys.txt   File to store proxies used in troll (Whoever created this may be an idiot, even though it is "proxies" and not "proxys").

The contents of the above files are separated by a new line.
- config.json  I'm not sure, but it's a file that stores some settings.
  ```
  {
    "token_format":true,
    "startime":true
  }
  ```
